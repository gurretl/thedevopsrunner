I am a Solution Engineer Cloud & AI Apps with a strong background in Infrastructure and DevOps. I've spent years helping teams build, deploy, and scale cloud-native solutions — from CI/CD pipelines and Infrastructure as Code to modern AI-powered applications. I am also a former Microsoft MVP.

I also run a [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/) where I share my knowledge and experiences in a more interactive way with an even wider audience. Whether it's deep dives into Azure, hands-on Terraform tutorials, or exploring the latest in AI tooling — I love making complex topics accessible and practical.

Beyond my professional credentials, I am driven by a passion for ultra-endurance sports, including ultra trail running and ski mountaineering. The grit and resilience required on the trails is the same mindset I bring to engineering challenges.
